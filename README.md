### Summary

Convolutional Neural Networks have greatly contributed to the success of Deep Learning
by outperforming all other image processing methods, and yet their opaque black-box
nature presents a considerable drawback, much like for all other types of Neurak Networks.
This issue has given rise to a plethora of methods attempting to make these models
more interpretable. Among them, one proposed an empirical equivalence between
Neural Networks and Polynomial Regression, which the NN2Poly method furthered by
obtaining an explicit expression for the polynomial representation of an arbitrarily deep
feed-forward fully-connected neural network.

The objective of this Master’s Thesis has been to extend the NN2Poly method to Convolutional
Neural Networks. This has been achieved for single-layer one-dimensional
CNNs, as well as for two-dimensional CNNs with kernel size k = 1. An approximation
of small order has been obtained for two-dimensional CNNs with kernel size k = 2. The
performance of the obtained expressions has been empirically tested through simulations.
